Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis and Insights

Welcome to the repository for my internship at Prodigy InfoTech! This repository is dedicated to documenting the work and learning outcomes from Task 1 of my internship experience, which centers on data cleaning, analysis, and deriving meaningful insights.

Task Overview
In Task 1, the goal is to create a bar chart or histogram to illustrate the distribution of a particular variable. This could involve either a categorical variable, like gender, or a continuous variable, such as age, to understand the spread and composition within a dataset. By visualizing data in this way, I aim to present demographic or dataset characteristics in a format that is easy to interpret and analyze.

Knowledge Gained
Through this task, I developed skills in data visualization, specifically learning how to construct bar charts and histograms. These visualizations help reveal the distribution patterns of categorical or continuous variables within a dataset, enabling more effective exploration of demographics or other relevant information. This experience has enhanced my ability to communicate complex data insights clearly and intuitively, making it easier to identify trends and patterns that inform decision-making.
